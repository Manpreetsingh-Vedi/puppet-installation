# Puppet Core Repository Setup Guide

This guide outlines the steps to set up and access the Puppet Core repository.

## Prerequisites

1. Create a user account on the Puppet Forge portal.
2. Set up multi-factor authentication for your account.
3. Generate an API key and set its expiration date.
4. Accept the Puppet Core EULA.

## Accepting the Puppet Core EULA

1. Log in to your Puppet Forge account.
2. Navigate to your profile.
3. Click on "Puppet".
4. Locate and click on "Puppet Core EULA".
5. Read and accept the document.

## Installing the Puppet Core Repository

1. Download the package:
wget --content-disposition <package_URL>
Replace `<package_URL>` with the appropriate URL for your system.

2. Install the package using dpkg:
sudo dpkg -i <file_name>.deb
Replace `<file_name>` with the name of the downloaded file.

Example for Ubuntu focal:
wget --content-disposition https://apt-puppetcore.puppet.com/public/puppet8-release-focal.deb
sudo dpkg -i puppet8-release-focal.deb

## Setting Up Authentication

1. Edit the authentication configuration file:
sudo vi /etc/apt/auth.conf.d/apt-puppetcore-puppet.conf

2. Add your credentials to the file:
machine apt-puppetcore.puppet.com
login forge-key
password <API_KEY>
Replace `<API_KEY>` with your actual API key.

Note: `forge-key` is a string literal and should be used as-is.

## Updating Package Lists

After setting up the repository and authentication, update your apt package lists:

sudo apt-get update

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues or errors, please ensure that:
- Your API key is correct and hasn't expired.
